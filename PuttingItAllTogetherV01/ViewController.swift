var story = ["Once upon a time, in the land of pirates and gold, Seaweed Sid, Captain Peg Leg and Captain Grey Beard stood on the edge of a pier looking for adventure.",
"After walking down the pier, the captains appeared on the ship with pride, ready to set sail on the bright sea.",
"Taking up their positions, the captains watched as the sails were unrolled and the skull and crossbones was raised.",
"As the ship began to set sail, the captains decided on an island to explore. After a few days of sailing they arrived at their destination ",
"Landing on the island, the crew began to explore and spotted something in the distance. It was a large temple that they went to investigate.",
"As they entered the temple the walls began to glow with light. Slowly they began to climb the stairs.",
"At the back of the room was a large chest. Inside it was piles of gold and gems for the pirates to take on their next adventure."]
